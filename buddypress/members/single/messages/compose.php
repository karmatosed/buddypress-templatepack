<p>Compose messages</p>
<p>This is dummy text (temporary), for the 'compose' template file. and this is set in 'messages.php' as the default item to show on mesages top level, for want of something better to show.</p>
<p>With this screen we still have the compose link on the submenu items for messages, at present this ill return blank as the compose action hasn't been added to the primary switch statement, but has been moved from the main switch to the inner switch so we see it here. Options ? we could remove submenu leaving access only by returning to top level messages or we can re-include the include for compose so the link works then we'll navigate to a view for just the compose  elements without the message thread list; so in effect 'Compose' will appear as a default screen on main messages untill you select a message thread to view or it can be accessed via submenu link.</p>
